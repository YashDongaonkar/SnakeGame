# 🐍 Classic Snake Game (Python Turtle)

A modern twist on the classic **Snake Game** built using **Python's Turtle module**. This project demonstrates clean **object-oriented programming**, **file-based high score tracking**, and fun, retro-style gameplay in a standalone Python app.

## 🎮 Features

* 🧠 **Modular OOP Design**

  * `Snake`, `Food`, and `Scoreboard` classes for easy readability and extension
* 📈 **High Score Tracking**

  * High score is saved to a local file and persists between game sessions
* 🚀 **Smooth Gameplay**

  * Continuous movement and collision detection.
* 🐢 **No external libraries required**

  * Fully built on the standard `turtle` module

## 🧩 Highlights

* High score is stored in `data.txt`
* Graceful game over handling
* Easy to expand: Add walls, power-ups, or different levels

## 🚧 TODO / Ideas

* 🧱 Wall mode (collision with boundaries)
* 🎨 Skins and themes
* 🔊 Sound effects using `playsound` or `pygame`
